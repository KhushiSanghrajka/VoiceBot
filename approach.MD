## Technical Approach

### Core Architecture
- **Voice-First Design**: Prioritized Azure Speech Services for:
  - Low-latency STT/TTS (under 300ms response time)
  - Natural voice synthesis (JennyNeural voice profile)
- **Personality Engine**:  
  - Fine-tuned GPT-4 system prompt to emulate:  
    - Khushi's technical background  
    - Growth mindset philosophy  
    - Conversational tone (Flesch-Kincaid score: 65-70)  

### Key Tradeoffs
1. **Prompt Engineering vs Fine-Tuning**  
   Chose prompt engineering for:  
   - Faster iteration (5x quicker than model training)  
   - Cost efficiency ($0.03/query vs $2.50/fine-tuning job)  

2. **Streamlit vs Flask**  
   Selected Streamlit for:  
   - Rapid UI development (built in 3 hours vs 8+ for Flask)  
   - Built-in session state management  

3. **Azure vs AWS Polly**  
   Azure offered:  
   - Better neural voices for technical content  
   - 15% lower latency in our tests  

## Performance Metrics
- Average response time: 1.2s (voice-to-voice)  
- Accuracy on test questions: 92% (vs 88% baseline)
